# TestEquipment
A list of my electrical test equipment and ongoing projects. I like test equipment. I like to repair things. Sometimes I repair test equipment.
This list is mostly for my own record-keeping, but if you'd like to offer advice on a project or ask about borrowing something, that's cool too.
For info on pieces I repair or refurbish, please see the associated repair log file.
